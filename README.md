# MINT : Skill-Based Learning Interface
Getting started
MINT is a skill-based learning interface that allows users to search for and add skills to their learning plan. Once a skill is added, users can access a set of tasks associated with that skill. Clicking on a task button will generate text that explains how to complete the task.
